# Clicker - Embedded

This directory houses code for a subcomponent of the [Clicker](https://github.com/sdiemert/clicker) project. The code here is intended to be run on an Arduino Nano that acts as an input device to detct "click" events. The arduino connects to the [Client](https://github.com/sdiemert/clicker/tree/master/client) component to upload its data.
